<h4><b>Who invented Bitcoin?</b></h4>
Amazingly, nobody knows who invented Bitcoin. We only know them by their screen name - Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi could be a single person, a group of programmers, or if you believe some of the weirder theories, a time-traveling alien or secret government team.Satoshi published a 9-page <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">document</a> in 2008, detailing how the Bitcoin system worked. Months later, in 2009, the software itself was released.
