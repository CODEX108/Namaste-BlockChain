<h4><b>Who invented Bitcoin?</b></h4>
Amazingly, nobody knows who invented Bitcoin. We only know them by their screen name - Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi could be a single person, a group of programmers, or if you believe some of the weirder theories, a time-traveling alien or secret government team.Satoshi published a 9-page <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">document</a> in 2008, detailing how the Bitcoin system worked. Months later, in 2009, the software itself was released.

<summary><h3>What is Web3?</h3></summary>
<br>
Web3 has become a catch-all term for the vision of a new, better internet. At its core, Web3 uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership.
Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users. Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. Before we talk about Web3, let's explore how we got here.
<hr>
<ul><h3>Core ideas of Web3</h3>
<li>Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
<li>Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
<li>Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
<li>Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

  <summary><h3>Web 1.0 VS Web 2.0 VS Web 3.0 </h3></summary>
  <br>
  <b>Web 1.0<b><br>
  <p>The first inception of Berners-Lee's creation, now known as 'Web 1.0', occurred roughly between 1990 to 2004. Web 1.0 was mainly static websites owned by companies, and there was close to zero interaction between users - individuals seldom produced content - leading to it being known as the read-only web.</p>
   <br> <b>Web 2.0<b><br>
   
   > If you're not paying for the product,You're the product
   
<p>The Web 2.0 period began in 2004 with the emergence of social media platforms. Instead of a read-only, the web evolved to be read-write. Instead of companies providing content to users, they also began to provide platforms to share user-generated content and engage in user-to-user interactions. As more people came online, a handful of top companies began to control a disproportionate amount of the traffic and value generated on the web. Web 2.0 also birthed the advertising-driven revenue model. While users could create content, they didn't own it or benefit from its monetization. Web 2.0 is the age of targeted advertising and the lack of privacy for it's users. </p>
    <br><b>Web 3.0- Read-Write-Own<b><br>
    
   > Privacy is in your hands
    
  <p> Web3 is supposed to be a more decentralised web that challenges the dominance of the tech giants by concentrating the power and data in the hands of the users, instead of the big tech corporations. This means that data is distributed across networks and no single entity owns the information.
  Web3 can power the new financial world order on ‚Äòmetaverse‚Äô and unleash innovation in online gaming, tokenisation of assets in virtual spaces and empower users to exercise complete control over their identity and data. </p>

<summary><h3>What is a block?üÖ±</h3></summary>
<br>
A blockchain network‚Äôs transactions are composed of sequential groups of data that are packaged together into ‚Äúblocks‚Äù strung together linearly. Each block also contains a set of transaction data that is processed once the block is finalized. The individual blocks that make up the larger blockchain contain crucial information for the functioning of the network. Each new block contains cryptographically verifiable data regarding transactions, as well as a numerical challenge that must be completed in order for the current block to be approved and added to the blockchain.

<p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. 

Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. 
The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is that a database usually structures its data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled, it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.</p>
<br>
> Key Takeaways
  1. Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information, blockchains 
  store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
  2. As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
  3. Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions.
  4. In Bitcoin‚Äôs case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control, rather all users collectively retain control.
  5. Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and      viewable to anyone.

<summary><h3>What is Proof Of Work?</h3></summary>

<p>PoW or proof of work is a special protocol that aims to deter cyber-attacks such as DDoS (distributed denial-of-service attacks), which can use up the resources of a computer stem with the help of multiple fake requests. It uses a trustless and distributed consensus system.

PoW implements a decentralized system and works without needing a central authority. The PoW consensus mechanism can verify transactions without needing a third party. PoW makes double-spending difficult by proving that every user has done several computations. Many other blockchain projects that copied the original Bitcoin code also follow the Proof of Work model.</p>

### How Does PoW Work?
![Diagram of Pow](https://www.guru99.com/images/pow-vs-pos-2.png)

<br>
<p>Proof of work requires an expensive computer calculation or, in other words, the process of mining. Mining needs to be performed to create trustless transactions on the blockchain.</p>

Step 1) Transactions are compiled and bundled up together in the form of a block.

Step 2) Miners then verify transactions within each block, checking to see if they are legitimate.

Step 3) Miners then solve a mathematical puzzle known as a proof of work problem to proceed. All miners have to compete.

Step 4) The first miner who solves each block problem is rewarded.

Step 5) The verified transactions are then stored on the blockchain.
<br>
> makes it expensive to cheat, but profitable to act honestly
<p>In Proof-of-work any block that includes an invalid transaction will be automatically rejected by the network. It‚Äôs expensive for you to even attempt to cheat. You‚Äôll waste your own resources without any reward.
<br>

### Advantages of PoW

- Proof-of-Work was invented to stop double-spending attempts.
- It is one of the most secure consensus mechanisms.
- Cryptos based on PoW has more mining power and are more secure.
- Mining earns rewards in a typical PoW model.
- Proof of work is random yet fair.

<summary><h3>What are Smart Contracts?</h3></summary>
<br>
Smart contracts are the fundamental building blocks of Ethereum applications. They are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allows us to convert traditional contracts into digital parallels. Smart contracts are very logical - following an if this then that structure. This means they behave exactly as programmed and cannot be changed.
