<h4><b>Who invented Bitcoin?</b></h4>
Amazingly, nobody knows who invented Bitcoin. We only know them by their screen name - Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi could be a single person, a group of programmers, or if you believe some of the weirder theories, a time-traveling alien or secret government team.Satoshi published a 9-page <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">document</a> in 2008, detailing how the Bitcoin system worked. Months later, in 2009, the software itself was released.

<summary><h3>What is Web3?</h3></summary>
<br>
Web3 has become a catch-all term for the vision of a new, better internet. At its core, Web3 uses blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs to give power back to the users in the form of ownership.
Instead of a Web monopolized by large technology companies, Web3 embraces decentralization and is being built, operated, and owned by its users. Web3 puts power in the hands of individuals rather than corporations. Before we talk about Web3, let's explore how we got here.
<hr>
<ul><h3>Core ideas of Web3</h3>
<li>Web3 is decentralized: instead of large swathes of the internet controlled and owned by centralized entities, ownership gets distributed amongst its builders and users.
<li>Web3 is permissionless: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.
<li>Web3 has native payments: it uses cryptocurrency for spending and sending money online instead of relying on the outdated infrastructure of banks and payment processors.
<li>Web3 is trustless: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.

  <summary><h3>Web 1.0 VS Web 2.0 VS Web 3.0 </h3></summary>
  <br>
  <b>Web 1.0<b><br>
  <p>The first inception of Berners-Lee's creation, now known as 'Web 1.0', occurred roughly between 1990 to 2004. Web 1.0 was mainly static websites owned by companies, and there was close to zero interaction between users - individuals seldom produced content - leading to it being known as the read-only web.</p>
   <br> <b>Web 2.0<b><br>
   
   > If you're not paying for the product,You're the product
   
<p>The Web 2.0 period began in 2004 with the emergence of social media platforms. Instead of a read-only, the web evolved to be read-write. Instead of companies providing content to users, they also began to provide platforms to share user-generated content and engage in user-to-user interactions. As more people came online, a handful of top companies began to control a disproportionate amount of the traffic and value generated on the web. Web 2.0 also birthed the advertising-driven revenue model. While users could create content, they didn't own it or benefit from its monetization. Web 2.0 is the age of targeted advertising and the lack of privacy for it's users. </p>
    <br><b>Web 3.0- Read-Write-Own<b><br>
    
   > Privacy is in your hands
    
  <p> Web3 is supposed to be a more decentralised web that challenges the dominance of the tech giants by concentrating the power and data in the hands of the users, instead of the big tech corporations. This means that data is distributed across networks and no single entity owns the information.
  Web3 can power the new financial world order on ‚Äòmetaverse‚Äô and unleash innovation in online gaming, tokenisation of assets in virtual spaces and empower users to exercise complete control over their identity and data. </p>

<summary><h3>What is a block?üÖ±</h3></summary>
<br>
A blockchain network‚Äôs transactions are composed of sequential groups of data that are packaged together into ‚Äúblocks‚Äù strung together linearly. Each block also contains a set of transaction data that is processed once the block is finalized. The individual blocks that make up the larger blockchain contain crucial information for the functioning of the network. Each new block contains cryptographically verifiable data regarding transactions, as well as a numerical challenge that must be completed in order for the current block to be approved and added to the blockchain.

<summary><h3>What are Smart Contracts?</h3></summary>
<br>
Smart contracts are the fundamental building blocks of Ethereum applications. They are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allows us to convert traditional contracts into digital parallels. Smart contracts are very logical - following an if this then that structure. This means they behave exactly as programmed and cannot be changed.
